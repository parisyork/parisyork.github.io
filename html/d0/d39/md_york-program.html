<p>Summary of sections: Design specification/program flow diagrams, motivation, using the API/functions, underlying mathematics, possible improvements and expansion MAXIM:[ a design document with detailed specification of the system be built and a summary of the testing process including the test cases run and passed - plus lessons learned] [Abstract] [Introduction] Visualizing and interacting with 3D objects, both real and virtual, is easy. Creating 3D objects in the mind’s eye and manipulating, moving, distorting and rotating is based wholly on our actual sense experience. Visualizing a four dimensional world is exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how dolphins see the world. Dolphins have binocular vision and see spatial relationships as we do; they also have sonar. This adds greatly more information about the world around than humans can perceive, namely simultaneously viewing the real spatial world with boundaries and the space within those boundaries. Much as Abbott[FOOTNOTE] described seeing a three dimensional creatures view of Flatland which allowed the interior of the Flatlanders to be seen along with the boundaries. This view however, is that of a two dimensional surface embedded in three dimensional space; as the Dolphins view is a three dimensional surface embedded in four space. Seeing the interior simultaneously with the boundaries does not provide a complete understanding of four dimensional objects in four space, lacking are several key points including a complete view of four space rotations and objects that can only exist in four space.</p>
<p>[Historical Basis of Work] A brief note on the motivations/possible uses for representing objects that exist in four space, I mean who really wants to just see a slice of an object embedded in four space? Also, the vast amount of mathematical information that is four dimensional, manifolds, surfaces and tangent/normal fields, There have been many different approaches to representing and interacting with four dimensional objects, see [FOOTNOTES OF PREVIOUS WORK].</p>
<p>The relationship between *this and four dimensional descriptive geometry [FOOTNOTE] is exactly the same as CAD and three dimensional descriptive geometry. That is, it accomplishes the same thing completely differently. Using an entirely analytical, math based, approach as opposed to the pencil and compass geometric approach.</p>
<p>Using a purely mathematical approach for the entire (pipeline/?) except for the final display gives us greater flexibility.</p>
<p>[Current Work] There is no current work, only current design… The software is a system to present four dimensional objects in an interactive and visually intuitive manner. Objects can be 4D analogs of actual 3D objects, like cubes, ellipses or surfaces from multidimensional functions and data sets. The paradigm of CAD is used for its prevalence/ wide adoption in many disciplines. CAD is the computer expression of three dimensional descriptive geometry, it is a direct approach to 3D object manipulation in two space. CAD for four space is a natural evolution; searching for the past several years has yielded no evidence that anyone has used the CAD interface paradigm to represent and interact with four dimensional objects. There exists a system of CAD4D[FOOTNOTE]. It has been used extensively for time domain information and construction planning. This is not at all what we are after.</p>
<p>[in the 3D case, we fold flat surfaces back up into three space to recreate the object &ndash;&gt; ]</p>
<p>Reconciling how the surfaces fold back into four space is not necessary for the software to accomplish. The software provides a way to understand the spatial relation between points in the projection spaces which help understanding of four space. Each projection face is a bounded three space.</p>
<p>Similar to three dimensional descriptive geometry, as implemented in computer aided design systems (CAD), we place a four dimensional object inside of a hypercube and take projections to three of its faces. In this case each face is a cube. The faces each have one less dimension than the actual object, the same as in the 3D counterpart.</p>
<p>The three projection views – Top, Front, Side (plan, front, side) [DIAGRAM]</p>
<p>In the 3D case, each view is a projection of a three dimensional object into a two dimensional viewing field. Standard 3D computer graphics do this, rending what is in the view frustum into a 2D mapping that can be displayed on the screen. One dimension is lost in the projection to create the 2D representation. There are two methods of projection depending on the lines of projection. Only the orthographic projections will be used in this application. Orthographic projections use lines of projection that are parallel. The parallel projection can be treated as a perspective projection if the far plane of the viewing frustum was at the infinity point.</p>
<p>When the projection is performed, one dimension is lost. Three dimensional objects have two projection views necessary to recreate the object because of the loss of one of these dimensions. In the projection display, it is necessary to have at least two orthogonal views of the object to recreate it.</p>
<p>3D Projection into 2D space Top or plan view: depth and width Front view: width and height Side view: depth and height</p>
<p>Any combination of two of the three views, results in all three spatial dimensions being represented. The final view (typically the side view) is included to enhance understanding. </p><pre class="fragment">Each projection of the 4D object is orthographic (projection lines parallel). The projections into three space are often referred to as shadows. A familiar shadow is that of the wireframe hypercube. Each projection has one less dimension than the whole object just as in the 3D case. 
</pre><p>4D Projection into 3D Space Top Front Side</p>
<p>Top view:</p>
<p>[DIAGRAM].</p>
<p>Analogy: A 3D object is placed in a cube, the points of the object are projected onto the faces of the cube, the cube is then unfolded.</p>
<p>A 4D object is placed in a hypercube, the points of the object are projected on the faces of the hypercube, and the hypercube is then unfolded.</p>
<p>Orientation of the projected 3D axes is not fixed to perspective views since there is no convention.</p>
<p>I will propose and implement the following </p><pre class="fragment">Front Cube: depth, width, height
Top Cube:  depth, height, 
Side Cube: Height, , width
</pre><p>If we take any two of the cube faces, as in the 3D version, we get all four spatial dimensions, and the final Cube Face is for clarity and understanding. Since it is exceedingly difficult to visualize four dimensional objects the third view becomes a necessity. [check this, three views should be necessary, create table] </p><pre class="fragment">It is possible with the aid of a computer to display three concurrent related 3D objects which represent the 4D object and this is the core purpose of the software. 
</pre><p> Visual [ 3D projection into 2 space for descript and analogous 4D projection into three space ]</p>
<p>What actual space are we working in? represented with homogeneous coordinates.</p>
<p>How are points represented? Points are represented as vectors with four elements, &lt;x,y,z,w&gt; for all calculations except for translation. How are polygons represented?</p>
<p>How do we project into 3 from 4 space? We use parallel projection from a point along the viewing axis. Projection from 4 to 3 along the w-axis:</p>
<p>( check this projection mathematics, this projection is done all the freaking time for wireframe shadows )</p>
<p>a point is chosen along the w-axis as the “eye” point; in parallel projection, the “eye” is at a point at infinity to ensure the lines of projection are parallel. A 3-plane ( hyperplane, three dimensional plane in fourspace) is then oriented to be between the object and the “eye” point and perpendicular to the desired projection rays.</p>
<p>All of the visible points in four space of the object are then projected on to the 3-plane along the lines of projection.</p>
<p>**This method, in the computer, effectively ignores whatever coordinate of the object’s points that exist along the axis of projection to generate the resulting 3-space point set of the object projection. [this is what we need to check]</p>
<p>e.g. projecting along the z-axis in four-space points (x1,y1,z1,w1), … , (xn,yn,zn,wn) become (x1,y1,w1), … , (xn, yn, wn)</p>
<p>Why do we project 3 times from four space? Three separate projections are taken from four space to three space. The direction of each projection is from a direction along one of the four axes. (no repetition of axes in projections) The reason for three separate projections is that when the object is projected, one dimension is lost. Three distinct views cover all four axes. Why do we have three (necessary) object view windows? Fourspace can be decomposed to four distinct 3D subspaces, namely : WXY, WXZ, XYZ, WZY hyperplanes How do we move objects in 4 space? – 5x5 homogeneous translation matrixes</p>
<p>This translates the point (x, y, z, w) to (x+a, y+b, z+c, w+d), and would be done to each point in the data set or model.</p>
<p>Scaling skewing of the model, check.</p>
<p>What axis can we rotate the object on? Quaternions or rotation matrixes All the same manipulations of three space objects can be done in four space and they are direct extensions of the existing functions, with addition of double rotation. Scaling is done using 4x4 matrices. Translation is done using 5x5 homogenous matrices, which necessitates changing the four vectors to five vectors with elements &lt; x, y, z, w, 1 &gt;</p>
<p>“rotation about an axis” has no definite meaning in four space. Building up from the threespace case: rotate about the x-axis. We fix the x-axis and rotate, this is a rotation of the YZ plane. [diagram]</p>
<p>Fourspace: rotate about the x-axis. We fix the x-axis and rotate , but wait, we have three perpendicular axes, and so we have two distinct rotations. If we fix x-axis, this still leaves the WY and YZ as possible planes of rotation. We must define the plane that is being rotated. [convoluted diagram]</p>
<p>Can we rotate the object on arbitrary axes? No. We can rotate arbitrarily about a point, but not as easily as defining a line to be the axis of rotation as in the 3D case. Fourspace has rotations and double rotations. [verify notation] Fourspace rotations are the SO3, and double cover threespace rotations—why quaternions are so useful. Rotation matrices extended to four dimensions can be used, but quaternions are already four space rotations and so it seems more direct to use them to represent and perform the four space rotations. This also allows multiple rotations to be combined and normalized with greater economy of calculations.</p>
<p>This software is intended to provide some insight to the connectivity, spatial relation, geometry, etc. of four dimensional objects. This is extremely difficult and there is no intuition about it. As such, all six rotational directions will be possible, but only one specific rotation [+/- degrees] at a time. Suggest control by slider or keyboard input.</p>
<p>Discussion of Groups in fourspace Alternative motivation for the visualization, gaining some additional insight to the special orthogonal groups, chiral rotations, &amp;ETC.</p>
<p>So we have our view windows, what can we do with it? Mapping a path through four-space and displaying the curve, could be neat.</p>
<p>How is model data stored and retrieved?</p>

<p>DEFINITION Four–dimensional space is the set E4 of ordered quadruple (x, y, z, w), where x, y, z, w are real numbers.</p>
<p>The quadruple (x, y, z, w) is called a point P in E4 and we write P =(x,y,z,w).</p>
<p>The numbers x, y, z, w are called, respectively, the x, y, z, w coordinates of P.</p>
<p>The coordinate axes are the sets of points: {(x, 0, 0, 0)} (x–axis), {(0, y, 0, 0)} (y–axis), {(0, 0, z, 0)} (z–axis), {(0, 0, 0, w)} (w-axis).</p>
<p>The only point common to all four axes is the origin O = (0, 0, 0, 0).</p>
<p>The coordinate hyperplanes are the sets of points:</p>
<p>(Hyperplanes in E4 are E3 such that the space is divided in two; any hyperplane of a Euclidean space has exactly two unit normal vectors)</p>
<p>{(x, y, z, 0)} (xyz–plane), {(x, y, 0, w)} (xyw–plane), {(x, 0, z, w)} (xzw–plane), {(0, y, z, w)} (yzw-plane).</p>
<p>The positive octant consists of the points (x, y, z, w), where x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0, z &gt; 0, w &gt; 0.</p>
<p>We think of the points (x, y, z) with z &gt; 0 as lying above the xy–plane, and those with z &lt; 0 as lying beneath the xy–plane.</p>
<p>We think of the points (x,y,z,w) with w &gt; 0 as lying “ana” xyz-hyperplane, and those with w&lt;0 as lying “kata” the xyz-plane.</p>
<p>Charles Howard Hinton coined the terms ana and kata for the names of movement along the w-axis. </p>
